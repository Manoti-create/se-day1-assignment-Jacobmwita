Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, method and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software system which involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintainance of software products.software engineering plays in technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and system that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) development of programming languages examples c, fortran 
b) established of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
c) advert of structured programming language in 1970s
d) the rise of agile methodologies in 2000s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements 
design -creating high level and detailed of software architecture and user interface 
implementation- writing code and building software according to design specification 
testing -conducting various test to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
deployment -releasing software to the users or the customers 
maintainance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases can be used in requirements, design and implementation flowing like a waterfall while Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to the change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
roles
software developer -responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions 
quality assurance engineer- enable software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager-oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated Development Environment -software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code eg visual studio, eclipse 
Version Control System - software tool for tracking changes to source and coordinating work among the team members eg git, subversion 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges requirements -requirements may change during development cycle leading to scope creeps and delay of project
tight deadline -pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development snd compressed quality 
technical depts- accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions technical depts can impede future development and compressed quality.
 strategy for overcoming challenges- including effective communication,agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines 
 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing -testing individuals components or module of software 
integration testing -testing interactions between different components and subsystems
system testing -testing the entire software system as whole 
acceptance testing -testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promt engineering-is all about crafting questions or statements to get the the best possible response for AI models it is important by making question clear and specific so AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
it uses keywords that guides AI towards the kind of response you want.
it craft effective prompts, be clear, specific and concise.
